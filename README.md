We have created tools to help individuals who are new to the stock market and would love to learn more. All while taking none of the finanical risk. 

The Stock Look Up allows you to see the past year of a company's trading history. Taking a closer look at the graph will show the daily open, close, high, and low.

The calculator allows you to visualize the market growth of a company over a time period. And with using real numbers, we can estimate how many shares would have changed in value.

Paper Trade allows you to simulate holding a portfolio of mulitiple different companies. You can choose how many stocks and how many shares you wish to purchase based off your wallet. Then after choosing a buy and sell date you can see how your portfolio preformed.

We came across many challenges. Some our challenges were trying to handle large amounts of data. Not always the system can handle such large time frames. One of the largest hurdles was originally setting up the frameworks. 

We are most proud of having have come up of with an idea and have most of it come to fruitation. 

We have learned a lot about the importance of planning ahead and the need to alter our course of action in face of challenges. 

We hope to future people's understanding of the stock market and add any feature to help do so.
